##### Hello, I am Mina Kim
<small>
I began my journey as an artist, exploring ways to connect more deeply with my audience. Surprisingly, that pursuit led me to programming, where I now find both creativity and precision in writing structured, efficient, and readable code.
  
Somewhere between 0s and 1s lies another kind of sublime—just as I once searched for meaning through art, I now discover beauty in logic, structure, and problem-solving. I’m eager to keep growing as a developer, combining creativity and precision in everything I do.
