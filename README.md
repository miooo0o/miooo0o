##### Hello, I am Mina Kim
<small>

Somewhere between 0s and 1s lies another kind of sublime.<br>  
I am always in love with the same thing—something quietly transcendent,<br>  
a presence that seems to arise the moment we name it.<br><br>  

Maybe that’s why, to me, art and code feel like the same thing—<br>  
except one crashes a little more often.
